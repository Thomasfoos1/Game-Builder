## Game Builder Project
Build simple web games without coding skills from an interactive interface.

My first intro to programming was a tool called Scratch, made by MIT students. This allowed to drag and drop coding blocks and create simple games. I thought a cool project would be to create a similar web-based tool.

Not only could this be a useful tool, but I also have the opportunity to imporove my skills in react on the frontend and learn GO in the backend.

# So far I have implemented the following:

Front end (React)
- Interactive Interface
- Adding multiple game objects
- Changing position and rotation dynamically
- Adding parameters for moving objects such as speed
- Uploading images to represent objects
- API calls to server

Back end (GO)
- Routing for accessing different resources
- Saving images to server
- Building HTML and JS to return to client to run in browser

# In the future I would like to add:
- Components to move game objects without user intput (ex. enemies)
- Loading existing projects
- Background images
- Collision between objects
- Sound effects
- Custom components where user can create variables, and perform actions
